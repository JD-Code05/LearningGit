# LearningGit
Here I put my notes on how to Git  
## Part 1 Introducion Sequence:  
A nicely paced introduction to the majority of git commands:  
- P1-1: Introducion to Git Commits
What is commit:  
-  records a snapshot of all the (tracked) files in your directory.  
- A giant copy and paste, but even better!  

What git wants to happen:  
- wants to keep your commits lightweight as possible, so it doesn't just blindly copy the entire directory every time you commit.  
- (When possible) compress a commit as a set of changes, or a "delta" from one version of the repository to the next.  

Git shows the History of Commits:  
- It maintains a history of which commits were made when.   
- Maintaining history is great for everyone working on a project.  

In order to use commit: git commit  
- P1-2: Branching in Git:
- P1-3: Merging in Git:
